Problem Statement: In this challenge, you are asked to implement a simplified version of the TypeRacer game to test typing speed.


Requirements:

* The UI should display a random paragraph
* The player must type a text into an input field
    - All characters are faded initially
    - If a character matches the corresponding character in the paragraph, it turns green
    - If a character is incorrect, it turns red, and all the subsequent characters also appear red until corrected.
* As soon as the user starts typing, start a timer of 30s.
* The game stops when either timer is over or the paragraph is completely typed out.
* Upon completion, shows the final typing speed in words per minute(WPM), accuracy and provide an option to retry.
* Backspace to clear the typed words should be supported.
